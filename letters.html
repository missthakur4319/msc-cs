<h1>💌 An Even Deeper, Intense Romantic Note For Uhh
</h1>

<div class="letter-box">
  <textarea placeholder=>"I wish I could show you what happens inside me every time I think of you…
because words will never be enough.

There’s a quiet pull in my heart — a gravity — that always leads back to you.
No matter how my day goes, no matter where I am, some part of me is always reaching for you… wanting your voice, your warmth, your presence.

You’ve become that softness I crave in a world that isn’t always gentle.
You’ve become the calm in my storms, the depth in my silence, the meaning in moments I never noticed before you.

And the truth is… I didn’t expect you.
I didn’t expect someone to touch me so deeply without even trying.
I didn’t expect my heart to recognize yours this quickly, this intensely, this completely.

But here I am — quietly falling, deeply feeling, endlessly choosing you…
not because I should,
not because it’s perfect,
but because my soul feels understood when it’s near you.

You’re not just someone I like.
You’re someone my heart doesn’t want to imagine life without.
Love You Chutki"</textarea>
